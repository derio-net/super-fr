# Acceptance Matrix — Backfill Rule (repo-wide)

## Rule

`docs/acceptance/matrix.yaml` is the registry of business-level acceptance
tests × verification levels × automation status. **Any PR that does one of
the following updates the matrix in the SAME PR:**

- adds or changes a spec `## Test Plan` (new spec ⇒ new rows; the CI
  staleness guard fails a spec with a Test Plan that no row cites)
- adds tests that verify an existing row (add the ref to `levels`, move
  `status` up: `not-implemented` → `skipped` → `ci`/`scheduled`)
- ships a surface or capability a `not-implemented` row waits on
- changes CI workflows that run matrix-referenced checks
- discovers a red acceptance: set `status: failing` — the
  `acceptance-report` workflow then FAILS by design until it is fixed or
  re-classified with reasoning in `notes`

Statuses move **explicitly, never silently**: `ci` | `scheduled` (automated
— the safe end) · `skipped` (verification exists, not in CI — warning,
backfill owed) · `not-implemented` (nothing exists — warning) · `failing`
(fails CI).

## How

- Add rows: `fr acceptance add --id ... --capability ... --acceptance ...
  --origin <repo>:<path> --level unit=<repo>:<path> --status ... --notes ...`
- Check: `fr acceptance check` (refs, staleness, statuses; exit 2 on
  `failing`). Nag: `fr acceptance status`.
- Local report: `fr acceptance report` → `docs/acceptance/report.html`
  (gitignored), links relative to sibling checkouts (`--sibling-root`,
  default `..`).
- CI: `.github/workflows/acceptance-report.yml` gates PRs touching specs /
  matrix / workflows, runs weekly, uploads the GitHub-linked report artifact
  and upserts the "Acceptance debt" issue.
