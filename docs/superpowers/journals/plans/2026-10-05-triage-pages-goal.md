### p1-preselected-wave-signature · discovery · preselected_wave keeps facts as its first argument (phase 1)

The plan wrote preselected_wave(judgements, among=...) but the real signature is (facts, judgements); stage derivation needs facts. Added among as a keyword only. Wave keys are strings.

### p1-board-https-href-test · discovery · page chrome adds relative hrefs to the board (phase 1)

test_a_non_https_url_produces_no_href asserted every anchor on the board is https; the nav bar links triage.html/origins.html/architecture.html/history.html. The test now allows exactly the PAGES file names (constants, never untrusted).

### p1-architecture-drops-kind-counts · discovery · architecture summary loses open/defect counts (phase 1)

Spec background lists kind counts as a fact on the board and the architecture summary. R6's summary is lines then/now plus Where it hurts, so the open-issues and defects figures (and issues filed, batches merged) left the architecture page: one home per fact. History also got a small MOVED map {waves: board} so an old manifest naming it is noted, not reported missing; architecture render_architecture lost its snapshots parameter since the timeline moved.

### p1-files-outside-list · discovery · touched beyond the obvious files (phase 1)

components.py gained BASE_CSS (shared prelude for architecture and history); origins.py lost the origin_counts/filings_chart re-exports (dead); triage_cmd.py registers the history command; tests/unit/test_triage_render.py and test_triage_board_views.py hold the board and finished-wave tests.

### p1-visual-matcher-uv-with · finding [open] (reviewer: out of scope) · capture-script witness misreads uv run --with (phase 1)

fr's capture-script witness misreads `uv run --with <pkg> python <script>` (value-taking flag read as the program), so a correctly run capture is reported unwitnessed

### no-refactor-p1-t1 · discovery · no-refactor-because P1.T1 (phase 1)

constant + smoke test only

### no-refactor-p1-t4 · discovery · no-refactor-because P1.T4 (phase 1)

nothing to clean beyond the views re-export

<!-- fr:journal kind=discovery scope=plan id=no-refactor-p1-t6 created=2026-10-05T21:44:33+00:00 phase=1 -->
### no-refactor-p1-t6 · discovery · no-refactor-because P1.T6 (phase 1)

no refactor needed beyond ordering

<!-- fr:journal kind=discovery scope=plan id=no-refactor-p1-t8 created=2026-10-05T21:44:33+00:00 phase=1 -->
### no-refactor-p1-t8 · discovery · no-refactor-because P1.T8 (phase 1)

board change is a filter plus a header call; nothing to clean

<!-- fr:journal kind=discovery scope=plan id=no-refactor-p1-t2 created=2026-10-05T21:44:33+00:00 phase=1 -->
### no-refactor-p1-t2 · discovery · no-refactor-because P1.T2 (phase 1)

the board/origins/architecture CSS preludes differ in table width, code styling and tab rules, so only the architecture/history shared prelude moved (BASE_CSS); folding origins and board in would change their rendering
